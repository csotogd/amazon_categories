The dataset is a simplified version of Amazon 2018, only containing products and their descriptions.
The dataset consists of a jsonl file where each is a json string describing a product.

I create a model that predicts main_cat using any of the other fields except category list.

The API is not working yet. the data preprocessing part still has some errors.
The work is unfinished
